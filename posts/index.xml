And even if they are using CoreGraphics and CGPath under the hood there was still no convinient way to visualize elements during debugging. So we decided to add Quick look support for Xcode debugger.
It&amp;rsquo;s possible to do that with implementing an objc function - debugQuickLookObject.</description>
