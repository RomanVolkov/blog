Recently I have passed a course [How to manage a Remote team](https://www.coursera.org/learn/remote-team-management/home/week/4) by GitLab. And if the course covers many aspects of transition from classic office environment I was interested specificly about challanges and ways to solve them within remote teams. And I can higlight few points for myself:
* Communication is a challange. With remote team setup you don't have ability to see that something is happening with your team member and the solution here: proactively asking how do person feel in general. That way I can try to help my team member as soon as possible.
* Transparent environment is critical. I believe it should be applied no matter if a team is remote or not, but transparency and keeping my team up-to-date helps people to be involved into company's life and be part of it
* Documentation is crucial. Everything has to be documented. Just everything. Technical setup, onboarding, general information, HR processed, benefits, workflows, etc. It helps people to be independent with their tasks and reduces amount of the same questions from different people. And it helps to create next point, which is
* Async workflow. Using sync workflow within several timezones could be nightmare for all involved. You still have to have sync calls/discussions, but many of them can be done via text or documentation pages.

The rest of the course is good too, but I've started it because of a question: how I can improve my current remote setup and make it more convenient for my team.
